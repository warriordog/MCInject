Note:  This project is abandonded!  I may return to it in the future, but for now it is unused.

MCInject is a Minecraft modding library that allows any mods using a custom classloader to easily edit code in other classes.  MCI is powered by Javassist, and uses simple configuration files to do all the hard work for you.  MCI can be used in many different ways, such as the Tweaker system included in the Minecraft Launcher or any custom classloaders implemented by mods.
